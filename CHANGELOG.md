### v2.2.3
- Update dependencies to latest versions.
- Fix maximum integer digits not accounting for minus (#41).

### v2.2.2
(skipped, accidentally uploaded a version identical as 2.2.1 to Maven Central, can't be removed)

### v2.2.1
- Fixed NPE when erasing after presenter is detached. (#28)

## v2.2.0
- Google's Material Components now used for UI.
- Lowered min SDK to 14.
- Added content description for the erase button.
- Initial value can now be negated. Previous behavior was to clear the value.
- Breaking changes in styling attributes:
    - Removed `calcHeaderStyle` and `calcHeaderElevationDrawable` attributes, they were replaced
        by `calcHeaderColor` and `calcHeaderElevationColor`. Note that the latter only applies to
        APIs below 21, otherwise default elevation color is used.
    - Renamed `calcNumberBtnStyle` to `calcDigitBtnStyle`, `calcNumberBtnColor` to `calcDigitBtnColor`,
      and `calcDialogSepColor` to `calcDividerColor`.
- Fixed crashes due to NumberFormat deserialization bug during unparcelization.

### v2.1.2
- Fixed many NPE on some devices.
- Fixed `Expression` parcel implementation.

### v2.1.1
- Disabled RTL layout in dialog.

## v2.1.0
- Added Hebrew translation.

### v2.0.1
- Fixed crash in writeToParcel on Android 5.0 with RTL language (#21).

# v2.0.0
- Changed package name to `com.maltaisn.calcdialoglib`.
- To change the dialog settings, `CalcDialog.getSettings()` must now be used.
- Order of operations is now applied by default. This can be changed with `setOrderOfOperationsApplied(Boolean)`.
- Added a setting to show the typed expression (`setExpressionShown(Boolean)`), which can also be edited (`setExpressionEditable(Boolean)`).
- Added a setting for choosing the numpad layout: like a phone (top row 123) or a calculator (top row 789).
- Added a min value setting separate from max value. As a consequence, `setSignCanBeChanged` setting was removed, use a minimum or maximum of 0 instead. If the minimum or the maximum is 0, special error messages like "Result must be positive" will still be shown.
- Added `calcHeaderElevation`, `calcHeaderStyle`, `calcExpressionStyle` and `calcExpressionScrollViewStyle` style attributes.
- Added getters to `CalcSettings` for better Kotlin interoperability.
- Added a `calcHeaderElevationDrawable` attribute, needed to customize the header before API 21.
- Changed `setValue(BigDecimal)` to `setInitialValue(BigDecimal)`.

- Changed `setShowZeroWhenNoValue(Boolean)` to `setZeroShownWhenNoValue(Boolean)`.
- Changed minus sign from hyphen `-` to unicode symbol `âˆ’`.
- Changed "Out of bounds" error behavior, now only shown when OK is pressed.
- Changed default maximum dialog height from 400dp to 500dp.
- Replaced all formatting settings with NumberFormat:
    - `setMaximumIntegerDigits`: maximum integer digits than can be typed, but more could be displayed.
    - `setMaximumFractionDigits`: maximum fraction digits than can be typed and displayed.
    - `setDecimalFormatSymbols`: change decimal separator, negative sign, grouping symbol, etc.
    - `setGroupingUsed`: enable or disable grouping.
    - `setRoundingMode`: change the rounding mode, also used for division by the calculator.
    - More settings available like prefix, suffix and minimum digits.
